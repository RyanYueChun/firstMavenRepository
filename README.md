# firstMavenRepository-secondProject
This project has my-app as a dependency.

Since my-app is a local project its .jar file can be automatically found in the local directory :
    ~/.m2/repository/com/mycompany/app/my-app/1.0-SNAPSHOT/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

The first project "my-app" just has to be compiled to be visible by this "second-app".
